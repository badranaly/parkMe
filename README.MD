parkMe is an app to help make parking easer for drivers.

Simple concept: 
 - Open app, sign up, and depending on what you are looking to do, you can hit a button to search for parking, or leave a parking spot
 - When you search for parking, you will be connected with a user who is leaving their parking spot.
 - Once parked, you can slide a button to confirm that you have been parked.
 - If you are leaving a spot, you can hit the leaving spot button, and it will notify the closest driver around that a spot is being made avaialble
 - Once connected, user will be able to see how far the driver looking for a spot is, and can confirm upon arrival that he is the user looking for a spot
 - A reward system will be implemented for those who are leaving their spots, in order to increase usability of app while parked.
